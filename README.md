# Choose Your Own Adventure: Parenthood Edition!

This repository is for a Choose Your Own Adventure game I created for my developmental psychology class (PSY 254 at Princeton University). 
The game was created using a Python (Flask) backend and an HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) frontend.

You can play the game here: https://cyoa-psy254.herokuapp.com/. 
Good luck with parenthood >;)!!
